Using the Christofides algorithm find the shortest path between selected points in the US
All distances will be in KM, and it will count the short distance by car.
***

# TODOs
- [ ] research APIs to have distance for all points
- [ ] using this API to create a wheighted connected graph
- [ ] solve using the Christofides algorithm
