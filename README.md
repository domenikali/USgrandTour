# US grand tour

Using the Christofides algorithm find the shortest path between selected points in the US
All distances will be in KM, and it will count the short distance by car.

# Method

For the api I chose the OSMR API based on Opne Street Map, using the 'request' library in python is possible to recive the query and know the shortest driving distance between two points
One of the

# TODOs

- [X] research APIs to have distance for all points
- [ ] using this API to create a wheighted connected graph
- [ ] find the shortest spanning tree
- [ ] solve using the Christofides algorithm
